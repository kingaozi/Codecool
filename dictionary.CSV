function | A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing_https://www.tutorialspoint.com
parametr | The parameter list consists of none or more parameters. Parameters are called arguments, if the function is called. The function body consists of indented statements. The function body gets executed every time the function is called. Parameter can be mandatory or optional. The optional parameters (zero or more) must follow the mandatory parameters_http://www.python-course.eu
variable | Is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value_https://en.wikipedia.org
argument | A value passed to a function (or method) when calling the function. There are two kinds of argument:keyword argument and positional argument_https://docs.python.org
dictionary | Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. While other compound data types have only value as an element, a dictionary has a key: value pair_https://www.programiz.com
tuple | In Python programming, a tuple is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas in a list, elements can be changed_https://www.programiz.com
ascii table | table of the numerical representation of a character_http://www.asciitable.com/
module | A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended_https://docs.python.org
string | Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes. Creating strings is as simple as assigning a value to a variable_https://www.tutorialspoint.com
list | The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that items in a list need not be of the same type_https://www.tutorialspoint.com
while loop | Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body_https://www.tutorialspoint.com
for loop | Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable_https://www.tutorialspoint.com
global | The global statement is a declaration which holds for the entire current code block. It means that the listed identifiers are to be interpreted as globals. It would be impossible to assign to a global variable without global, although free variables may refer to globals without being declared global_https://docs.python.org
if | The if statement is used for conditional execution.It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one by one until one is found to be true (see section Boolean operations for the definition of true and false)_https://docs.python.org
github | is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features_https://en.wikipedia.org
